# SoapJS
## OMG, Yet Another Framework
Yes, we know there are many frameworks out there, and they are excellent. However, there's a gap: separating logic from the framework itself to ease the trouble during migration or framework switching. As backend developers, we often had to rewrite code tailored to specific frameworks. SoapJS, rooted in Clean Architecture, offers customizable code structures through configuration files and presets, allowing you to decide on your code's structure. We provide a solution that can be adapted and applied as preferred, eliminating the need to start from scratch. Our CLI facilitates file generation based on configurations, letting developers focus on writing the actual code.

## Description
**SoapJS** is a framework designed to empower developers by adhering to the principles of Clean Architecture, enhancing modularity and maintainability in web application development.

## Getting Started
Everything you need to know can be found at [SoapJS Documentation](https://docs.soapjs.com). If you want to install the package immediately, use the command `npm i @soapjs/soap`. However, we recommend familiarizing yourself with the documentation and CLI at the provided address.
